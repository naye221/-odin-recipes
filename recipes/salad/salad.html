    <li>8 slices salami, or more to form 2 rows</li>
    <li>¼ cup tomato sauce, or other crushed tomato product</li>
    <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or more to cover</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>

    Directions Instructions </h1>
<ul id="ul">
    <li>Step 1
        Generously flour a work surface. Flatten out dough to form a rough rectangle. Flour top surface and roll out to a 1/4- to 1/2-inch thickness.
        </li>
    <li>
        Step 2 
        Leaving an inch or so of the long edge uncovered, arrange salami slices in a single row without overlapping them. Create 2 single-layer rows, leaving a wider uncovered edge on the other side. Spread tomato sauce over salami. Generously cover with grated cheese, parsley, and oregano. Brush edges of dough with water.
    </li>
    <li>Step 3
        Begin rolling from the long edge closest to the salami. Roll fairly tightly without pressing or stretching dough too much to allow it room to rise, pinching in the ends as you go. Finish with seam side down. Carefully transfer roll to a rimmed baking sheet lined with a silicon mat. Cover with a dry towel and allow to rise until doubled, 60 to 90 minutes.</li>
    <li>Step 4
        Lightly brush top and sides of loaf with olive oil. Cut 1-inch deep slits diagonally across the top of the loaf, about 2 inches apart. Dust with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Step5
            Bake in preheated oven on center rack until nicely browned and cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer loaf to a cooling rack. Cool completely before slicing.
        </li>
